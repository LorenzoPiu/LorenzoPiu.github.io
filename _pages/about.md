I am a researcher at Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles, pursuing a PhD co-supervised by RWTH Aachen University. My fellowship is part of the Horizon Europe MSCA program, which funds the [ENCODING](https://encoding.ulb.be) project. Since my master's studies, I have specialized in computational fluid dynamics, combustion, and machine learning.'

Research
======
My current research interests are turbulent combustion modeling and deep learning. The goal of my PhD is to train neural networks on high-fidelity data to gain insights into turbulence-chemistry interaction. The main challenge of the approach is the model generalizability, that I am trying to improve focusing on Bayesian techniques to quantify uncertainty in neural networks. Our latest [research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10494-024-00626-3) proposes a hybrid data-driven/physics-based framework to model the chemical source terms in Large Eddy Simulations.

Previous
======
I studied Aerospace Engineering at Politecnico di Torino, with a thesis on multiphase heat exchangers at the Von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics.

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
