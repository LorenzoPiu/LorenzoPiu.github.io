I am a researcher at [Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles](https://www.ulb.be), pursuing a PhD co-supervised by [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~a/root/). My fellowship is part of the Horizon Europe MSCA program, which funds the [ENCODING](https://encoding.ulb.be) project. Since my master's studies, I have specialized in computational fluid dynamics, combustion, and machine learning.

Research
------
My current research interests are turbulent combustion modeling and deep learning. The goal of my PhD is to train neural networks on high-fidelity data to gain insights into turbulence-chemistry interaction. The main challenge of the approach is the model generalizability, that I am trying to improve focusing on Bayesian techniques to quantify uncertainty in neural networks. Our latest [research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10494-024-00626-3) proposes a hybrid data-driven/physics-based framework to model the chemical source terms in Large Eddy Simulations.

Previous
------
I studied Aerospace Engineering at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it), with a thesis on multiphase heat exchangers at the [Von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics](https://www.vki.ac.be). During my Master's, I joined for two years H2politO, a students' team that designs sustainable vehicle prototypes.
